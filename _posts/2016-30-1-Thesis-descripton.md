Due to the ever increasing range and complexity of threats in cyber space, detection becomes an increasingly vital part of an organizations cyber security program. Even with well defended networks we see time and time again that only preventative measures are not enough to get the job done. In addition to that the annual Verizon data breach report has shown that time from compromise to detection has remained far too long. [1]
These threats coupled with the lack of trained cyber security specialists indicates the need for new highly effective training programs both for the people still studying and experienced professionals working in the field who want to expand and enhance their skill set. [2]
Time shortage on both the learners and teachersâ€™ sides, the decoupled nature of traditional learning materials from real world cases and up until now the difficulties of providing a dynamic and sufficiently complex technical infrastructure has limited how a course on cyber attack detection might be provided.
