Due to the ever increasing range and complexity of threats in cyberspace, detection becomes an increasingly vital part of an organization's cyber security program. Even with well defended networks we see time and time again that only preventative measures are not enough to get the job done.
In addition to that the annual Verizon data breach report has shown that time from compromise to detection has remained far too long.
These threats coupled with the lack of trained cyber security specialists indicates the need for new highly effective training programs both for the people still studying and experienced professionals working in the field who want to expand and enhance their skill set.
Time shortage on both the learners and teachers’ sides, the decoupled nature of traditional learning materials from real world cases and up until now the difficulties of providing a dynamic and sufficiently complex technical infrastructure has limited how a course on cyber attack detection might be provided.

Today’s massively scalable and virtualized environments offer us new ways of teaching cyber security. Add to that the proven efficiency of simulations in training cyber security specialists and we have a perfect recipe for teaching cyber attack detection.

The author’s master’s thesis proposes a scalable course on cyber attack detection, where teaching is done through mostly practical simulations with enough theoretical materials to cover the basics.
This means that the learner goes through the theoretical materials to acquire the necessary knowledge base. Then proceeds to actually build several crucial components of the necessary monitoring infrastructure and finally complete several sequential red team blue team simulations where they learn to use the previously built tools to detect example attacks based on the real world. A close real world approximation of this is the Cyber Olympics recently held at the Estonian Information Technology College. Unlike the Cyber Olympics where the participant has to show their skill set, this course focuses on teaching a subset of the necessary skills that are a must to participate in the Cyber Olympics.

Now that we have covered the why and the how, we will take a closer look at the course itself.
Starting off with the scalable part. What this means is that by using the RangeForce platform, we can provide the same course to nearly an unlimited amount of people at the same time. The course is free of traditional teaching constraints like location, capacity of the room and the time constraints of the instructor. The learner can choose the time and place to go through either the materials or the hands on labs.
Some restrictions still remain. Based on feedback collected by Margus Ernits, several business customers have expressed the requirement to keep each hands on labs to no longer than 45 minutes a piece.

The course itself will cover the basics of monitoring network traffic using IDS/IPS solutions. Central collection, correlation and visualization of log data to gain insights into what's happening in the infrastructure. Finally rule creation for both IDS solutions and log correlation tools are covered that stop or detect simulated attacks. In this final part the student has the ability to get immediate feedback, since they are writing rules to detect simulated attacks that are automatically done during the same lab session. Do the right thing and you detect the attack, thereby completing an objective.

Upon completion of the course, the learner should be able to set up the necessary components of a basic monitoring infrastructure and utilize them to detect cyber attacks.
